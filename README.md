# creating-base-control-panel
in this project, the base control panel is integrated with Arm's control panel in one web page that created in the first task.
the base control page has 4 buttons for different directions and one button for stop the robot.
the web page is designed for mobile and tablet screens,so it is responsive web page.
when you click on any button, the value will be updated in the database.
finally, we have the fetch_dataForBaseControl.php file to read the value from the database.
